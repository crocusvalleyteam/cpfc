### thecroydonproject 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thecroydonproject/thecroydonproject.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thecroydonproject/thecroydonproject)


#### intro  

the golang and aws croydon group consist of punch of local techies who decided to play thier part in making croydon the next big thing.  

 The goup aims to 

1) encourage learning by association 
2) teach and train 
3) build good apps to make the learning process and the meet-ups fun and productive 
4) use latest ideas in deploying distributed applications

  
#### the project  

Thecorydonproject project is the group's idea to build something,   the project   will aim to build a distributed micro services restful app and dynamically deploy it across 4 hosting platforms (aws, google, digitalocean .. etc).
 
##### why?
 
 we want to see and learn how to face the two things that scares everyone;   
 1) going live and production deployment 
 2) migrating 
     
     
##### the concept:  

the idea is to do  4 things;

1) build a Go app to simple restfull GET access to all known crystal palace FC games. the app will consist of storage, database, middle and frontend.  
2) automate the deployment of the 4 layers across hosting platforms   
3) burst form 1 or 2 units per layer to a big number   
4) shuffle the hosting units and see what happens 

 
#### outcome:  

1) learn
2) play
3) build
4) teach others


#### the picture 

we like to communicate in pictures : see it 

##### The application


the application will consist of;

1) postgres database to hold historical results of the best club in the world     
2) A restfull service to serve all or selected game stats (season, period, datae, kick-off time, home or away, opponent, reuslt at halftime and final score)   
3) a middle layer  to provide some-logic to mauniplute the data  
4) frontend to display the results
